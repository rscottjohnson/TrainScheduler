# TrainScheduler
### A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host data.

#### 06/05/18 - Scott Johnson

## Project Goal
TrainScheduler incorporates the Firebase database platform to host arrival and departure data.  The app then retrieves and manipulates this data with the Moment.js JavaScript library.  Administrators of the app should be able to submit:

  * Train Name
  * Destination
  * First Train Time -- in military time
  * Frequency -- in minutes
  
The app should then calculate when the next train will arrive relative to the current time.  Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

## Project Usefulness
This project demonstrates a website that provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.  It demonstrates both the use of the Firebase database to store and retrieve data, as well as the Moment.js JavaScript libary to work with and format time values.
